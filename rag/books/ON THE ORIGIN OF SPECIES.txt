FUN FACT

It took over 20 years for Darwin to research, develop and finally publish his book.

There’s been a handful of controversial books that have shaken up the very ground in which we build our beliefs on…. and Charles Darwin’s famous ‘On the origin of species’ has been like no other.

It all started on December 27, 1831, when the young naturalist left Plymouth Harbor aboard the HMS Beagle to spend the next (what turned out to be five long) years gallivanting around the globe conducting research on plants, animals and the environment in which they preside.

His adventure turned into one of the greatest discoveries in the history of mankind - the theory of evolution. What Darwin found along his travels, and what he would eventually declare to the scientific community and broader world, was that existing organisms better suited for adaptation to their environment survive, while those that are poorly suited to their environment do not.
